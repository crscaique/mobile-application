# mobile-application :iphone:

Hey everyone!

Have a look at my process of building a mobile app from scratch!

The goal is to develop an app that approaches students and teachers remotely. In other words, it facilitates students' access to their grades, allows the lecturer to post students' grades and general updates, and allows the staff to post notifications.

A couple of points to be made..

1. Student Teacher Integration is an app developed using XML and Kotlin language
2. The first version of the project did not count with a database. This implementation was done in the second version of the app
3. Firebase - Firestore and SQLite are the databases used for the app
